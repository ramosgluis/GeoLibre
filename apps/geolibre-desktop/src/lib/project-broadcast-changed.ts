/**
 * Reference-compares the store fields that feed a project snapshot. Every
 * mutating store action produces new refs for the slice it touches, so this is
 * a cheap, correct "did the broadcastable project change?" check that ignores
 * selection, UI, and collaboration-slice churn.
 *
 * `mapView` is deliberately NOT compared: each participant keeps their own
 * camera (applyRemoteSnapshot overrides the incoming view), so broadcasting a
 * full-project snapshot on every pan/zoom only churns receivers' layer
 * reconciliation for no visible effect — and that churn was intermittently
 * crashing the map under rapid panning. Camera is shared through presence
 * (viewport rectangles + opt-in follow-host) instead.
 *
 * The compared fields must stay aligned with `buildProjectSnapshot` (minus
 * camera): models, processing history, dashboard widgets, map grid, and the
 * project style library are part of the snapshot payload and must trigger a
 * broadcast when they change on their own.
